# Audit Applications

Below are current audit application tests that I am able to share. 

<b>Duplicate Test

This application allows the user to select a file and define what exactly a duplicate is in a file, and then the application pulls out all detail for all of the duplicate pairings and puts it into an Excel spreadsheet. I designed this program because duplicate functions in programs typically remove duplicates. When I am doing a process analysis, I want to see all of the duplicates so I can assess the issue. 

<b> Null Count

I am currently working on a data a quick data profiling application. This is the first part of it. It quickly summarizes all of the nulls in a file for each field. This gives the user an idea of which fields are good to use for data analysis and if there are any fields that shouldn't have a missing item that do.

<b> Table Comparison

This program compares two tables together that have common ids between them. The output for this program is it will produce a tab that says what matched, what did not match from the first table and what did not match from the second table. 

<b> Random Sample Generator

This is just a simple random sample generator. The user inputs the number of items they want and the application provides a random sample in an Excel spreadsheet.
